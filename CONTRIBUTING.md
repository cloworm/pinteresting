# How to contriute:

## Bug reports / issues

 - Is something broken or not working as expected?
   Check if there is an [existing issue](https://github.com/cloworm/pinteresting/issues).
   If there's not, [create a new one](https://github.com/cloworm/pinteresting/issues/new)

## Contributing code

 1. [Fork and clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
 2. Follow the [set-up instructions](https://github.com/cloworm/pinteresting#set-up-for-development-environment) in the README.
 3. Make the changes you want and back them up with tests (once we introduce tests into this app)
 4. Commit and create a pull request with details as to what has been changed and why
  * Use well-described, small (atomic) commits.
  * Include links to any relevant github issues.

### How Pull Requests will be handled

 * If the pull request looks good, I will merge it.
 * If the pull request needs to be changed,
  * You can change it by updating the branch you generated the pull request from by adding more commits
  * I may make changes myself and manually merge the code in.
